      <title>Salinity And Stratification at the Sea Ice Edge (SASSIE)</title>
      <link>https://zippelsf.github.io/project/sassie/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sea ice extent in the Arctic Ocean has declined dramatically over the past decades. Autumn ice advance is slower and occurs later, while summer ice retreat is faster and occurs earlier. The result is a lengthening open-water period each year, leading to changes in air-sea heat and momentum fluxes, the freshwater cycle, surface albedo feedbacks, primary production, and regional and global climate as well as human and ecological health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our experiment will examine how summer ice melt evolves into and is inexorably linked with autumn sea ice advance, focusing on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quantifying the salinity anomalies generated by melting ice, how they evolve in time, and how they affect stratification, sea surface temperature (SST), and subsequent ice advance;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exploring these processes using a series of model experiments; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collecting data to enable improved satellite sea surface salinity (SSS) retrievals in polar oceans, and linking the in situ salinity signals with those observed from satellites.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SASSIE will address its science themes in a multi-scale in situ, airborne, satellite, and modeling experiment. The primary aim of the field campaign is to capture the upper ocean structure during the transition from summer sea ice retreat to autumn sea ice advance. We will quantify the strength, size, and depth of fresh near-surface anomalies resulting from melting ice; the horizontal and vertical structure of those fresh anomalies as they evolve due to air-sea fluxes and waves, ocean currents and mixing; and the ocean conditions and the presence of sea ice as it begins to form.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>O2 Flux at WBNERR</title>
      <link>https://zippelsf.github.io/post/o2-flux-at-wbnerr/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 15 Oct 2020 09:45:01 -0400</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week, Matt Long and I are testing a new theory we have about how much oxygen can be transfered between the air and water in estuaries and ponds. Currently, nost scientists apply a formula for this transfer (called the gas transfer velocity, because it has units of m/s) based only on the wind speed. This works in the open ocean where waves have room to grow, and are typically in lock step with the local wind. In small ponds and estuaries, the distance wind can blow over water (called fetch) limits the growth of waves, and changes how much turbulence is at the air/water boundary. These smaller waves and modified turbulence levels then change how much gas can be exchanged across the interface. We are collecting data this week at Waquoit Bay to test a new formula that includes fetch in estimating the gas tranfer velocity. Our hope is that this will improve estimates of oxygen flux in nearshore regions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Air/Sea Fluxes Mediated by Pressure Work</title>
      <link>https://zippelsf.github.io/project/pressure-work/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Drs. Seth Zippel, Malcolm Scully, and  Jim Edson are seeking a doctoral student for an NSF-funded project to study turbulence in the oceanic and atmospheric boundary layers. We are hoping to understand the role of ocean waves, wave breaking, and turbulent pressure in atmosphere and ocean exchanges, which are central to understanding air/sea transfer of heat, gasses, and momentum. We will conduct two field experiments with a tower in Pamlico sound, NC, collecting wave, turbulence, and pressure data on both the atmosphere and water sides of the boundary. These findings will help improve our fundamental understanding of air/sea interactions, which are central to weather, climate, and upper ocean transport for biota, plastics, and other tracers.&lt;/p&gt;
